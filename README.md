# Math Path
A creative Python project that implements the factorial, Fibonacci, and GCD math algorithms, using both iterative and recursive approaches.

---

## Features

- Factorial (iterative & recursive)
- Fibonacci (iterative & recursive)
- Greatest Common Divisor using Euclid's  (iterative & recursive)
- Proper error handling with exceptions
- Comprehensive & edge testing with `pytest`
